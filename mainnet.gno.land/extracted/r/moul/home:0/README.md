# `gno.land/r/moul/home`

The realm behind **https://gno.land/u/moul**. A profile page whose content is
data, not code: update a paragraph with one small transaction instead of
redeploying a realm.

## Why this one has no `/vN`

It is the only contract in this repo at an unversioned path, and that is forced,
not a slip.

gnoweb builds a user profile by calling `Render("")` on the realm at the **exact**
path `/r/<username>/home` and embedding the result as the page body
([`gno.land/pkg/gnoweb/handler_http.go`][handler], `GetUserView`). That lookup does
no version resolution, so `gno.land/r/moul/home/v0` would never be found. The bare
path *is* the interface with gnoweb.

Versioning moves inside instead: content lives in slots (below), and the code can
be replaced in place because the package is `private`.

This is also why `gnopm bump` refuses this package: it looks for a trailing
`/vN` on the module line to increment and there is none. The module line stays
bare, `gnopm status` and `gnopm verify` accept it, and only `bump` is off the
table. A compatibility change here is a redeploy of the same path, not a new
version.

### What it replaces: `gno.land/r/moul/home/v0`

This directory used to hold a different realm: a hand-maintained dashboard with
a todo list, a status string and a meme URL, its state mutable only by the admin
and its *shape* only by redeploying. It never reached any network
(`contracts.json` had it `uploaded: false` everywhere), so nothing on chain is
being replaced, only the source.

That version is not deleted, it is **pinned to history** in `gnomod.lock` the way
`AGENTS.md` prescribes for a superseded version:

```toml
[[module]]
module = "gno.land/r/moul/home/v0"
source = { commit = "4f2df83869b80470eb81c48a82fdbe82256b8113", dir = "r/moul/home" }
```

So it keeps resolving for anything that imports it, `gnopm sync` materializes it
under `.gnopm/`, and it is still linted and tested from there. Read the code at
[`r/moul/home` @ 4f2df83][v0], the last commit where this directory held it.

## Slots

The page is assembled from **slots**: named markdown fragments in an avl tree.

| function | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Set(cur, slug, body)` | create or replace one slot, the ordinary update |
| `Append(cur, slug, body)` | append, for a body too large for one transaction |
| `Delete(cur, slug)` | remove a slot |
| `Get(slug)` | read one body |
| `Manifest()` | `slug⇥rev⇥len⇥sha256` per slot, the diff surface |
| `Revision()` | total writes accepted, so a client can tell "nothing moved" |

Writes are restricted to `g1manfred47kzduec920z88wfr64ylksmdcedlf5`.

A slug is 1–64 bytes of `[a-z0-9._-]`. No `':'`, so a slug can never break out of
its own `:slug:` placeholder.

## The layout is a slot too

`Render("")` takes the slot named `layout` as its template and fills every
`:slug:` placeholder in it with `p/moul/dynreplacer`. So the shape of the page
(headings, order, what appears at all) changes without touching the code:

```
<gno-columns>
![Manfred Touron](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94029?s=400)
<gno-columns-sep />
# Manfred Touron

:bio:

:social:
</gno-columns>

## Packages

:packages:
```

`<gno-columns>` / `<gno-columns-sep />` are gnoweb's own extension, not HTML:
raw HTML is not rendered, these are parsed. Adding a section is a **content**
change, never a code one: the renderer registers one placeholder per slot by
iterating the tree, so writing `content/social.md` and referencing `:social:`
is the whole of it.

### The slots this page ships with

`content/` is the source of truth, one file per slot, the slug being the file
name without `.md`. Nothing registers them: `gnohome` reads the directory and
the realm iterates the tree.

| slot | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bio` | who I am, and what this page is, in the header column |
| `social` | the links under it |
| `now` | what I am working on, hand-written |
| `stack` | the tools, one line |
| `numbers` | a counted table, with the date it was counted |
| `packages` | **generated**, see below |
| `about` | a collapsed `> [!NOTE]-` explaining that this page is a realm |
| `layout` | the template all of the above are filled into |

`about` is deliberately last and deliberately collapsed. gnoweb renders an alert
as `<details>`, and a `-` after the type closes it
(`gno.land/pkg/gnoweb/markdown/ext_alert.go`), so the mechanism is one click away
instead of occupying the paragraph where a reader decides whether to keep going.

### `layout` may only reference placeholders that are deployed

An unmatched placeholder survives into the output verbatim (see below), which
makes the layout slot the one file that can be **ahead of the chain in a way
that shows**.

Rule: before pushing `layout`, every `:slug:` in it is either a file in
`content/` or a computed placeholder **the deployed code answers**, which is not
the same as one this repo implements.

⚠️ **This is currently true of `layout` itself.** It ends with
`On mygnoscan: :scan.links:`, and `scan.gno` is in this repo but **not in the
deployed package**: `vm/qfile` on `gno.land/r/moul/home` lists six files and
none of them is `scan.gno` (re-read 2026-09-28 through mygnoscan's
`/api/realm`, the RPC being blocked from that host). So `layout` must not be
pushed on its own. It goes out with the redeploy that carries `scan.gno`, which
also wipes every slot and is therefore followed by `gnohome tx -all` anyway.

Both of that redeploy's dependencies are now live on mainnet, so it is no
longer blocked: `p/moul/mygnoscan` and `r/moul/config/v1` both answer
(checked the same day). What is left is the `MsgAddPackage`, which no account
session may sign.

`gnohome status` is the check, and `tools/gnohome/scan.go` makes `preview`
render these links rather than showing a literal `:scan.links:`, so the page
can be judged before any of it is signed.

### Images: two gates, and neither is the one you expect

An image in a slot passes **gnoweb's validator** and then the **CSP the site is
served behind**. They block different things, and only the second is a domain
list:

- gnoweb's `AllowSvgDataImage` (`gno.land/pkg/gnoweb/render_config.go`, wired in
  `markdown/ext_imgvalidator.go`)
  rejects every `data:` URI that is not `image/svg+xml`, and blanks the `src`
  rather than dropping the tag. Ordinary `https://` URLs are not checked at all.
- The live `content-security-policy` header on gno.land pins `img-src` to
  `'self' data:` plus a fixed host list: `*.githubusercontent.com`,
  `*.github.io`, `github.com`, `imgur.com`, `*.imgur.com`, `assets.gnoteam.com`,
  `sa.gno.services`, `gnolang.github.io`, `ipfs.io`, `cloudflare-ipfs.com`
  (read 2026-09-19). Anything else is silently not painted by the browser, with
  the HTML looking perfectly fine.

So a GitHub avatar needs no hosting of its own:
`https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/94029?s=400` matches
`*.githubusercontent.com` and renders as-is. Verified by running this exact
page through gnoweb's real goldmark pipeline, not by reading the policy.

Eleven placeholders are computed at render time rather than stored, and are
refused as slot names so nothing can shadow them.

Six come straight from chain state: `:owner:` `:realm:` `:chainid:` `:height:`
`:rev:` `:slots:`.

Five are explorer links, built by [`p/moul/mygnoscan`](../../../p/moul/mygnoscan)
(`scan.gno`): `:scan:` is the explorer base URL as plain text, `:scan.realm:`
`:scan.me:` `:scan.block:` are markdown links to this realm, to the owner's
account and to the block being rendered, and `:scan.links:` is the three of
them on one line.

Which explorer they point at is read from
[`r/moul/config`](../../../r/moul/config), not hardcoded here, so moving every
one of moul's realms to a different instance is one transaction against that
realm rather than a redeploy of each. With nothing configured, they fall back
to `mygnoscan.DefaultBase`, which is what a fresh chain renders.

Three properties worth knowing:

- **Lazy.** dynreplacer only invokes the callbacks whose placeholder actually
  occurs in the layout, so an unused slot is never read out of the tree.
- **Single-pass.** A placeholder inside a slot *body* is left alone. No slot can
  expand into another, so no cycle exists.
- **Order-independent.** Every placeholder is `:slug:` and a slug cannot contain
  `':'`, so no placeholder is a prefix of another and the replacer has no
  ambiguity to resolve.

An unmatched placeholder survives into the output verbatim. That is deliberate: a
missing section should be visible, not silently blank.

### Other render paths

- `:slots`: the slot index (name, size, revision, height of last write)
- `:slots/<slug>`: one slot's raw markdown, fenced

## Why `private`

`gnomod.toml` declares `private = true`. On gno.land that means two things:

1. **No other realm may import this one.** Fine for a profile page.
2. **The creator may re-add the package at this path.** `AddPackage` waives its
   already-exists refusal for a private package and binds the replacement to the
   address in `[addpkg].creator`.

⚠️ **A redeploy re-runs `init()` and resets all realm state.** The slots are gone.
That is why `content/` is the source of truth and why `gnohome tx -all` exists:
after a redeploy, push every slot back.

The intended path is that this never happens. Slots cover content and the layout
slot covers presentation, so the code should not need to change.

## Local workflow

`tools/gnohome` is the local half: it builds the slots from `content/*.md`, renders
the page offline exactly as the realm would, diffs against the chain, and prints
the `gnokey` commands for what is outdated, nothing else.

```sh
go -C tools tool gnohome preview   # see the page before anyone else does
go -C tools tool gnohome status    # what differs from the chain
go -C tools tool gnohome tx        # the commands to fix that
```

⚠️ **`gnohome preview` is the only preview of this realm that means anything.**
The CI preview link deploys the package to a fresh dev chain, where there are no
slots and `content/` never travels (the uploader skips sub-directories), so it
always renders `defaultLayout` and is identical on every content-only PR.
Confirmed on PR #225, whose preview reads "No layout slot yet" while the change
was six slots. The bot cannot know this and links it anyway.

The `packages` slot is generated, not written: it is a claim about what is
deployed, and `contracts.json` already tracks that per network.

```sh
go -C tools tool gnohome packages > r/moul/home/content/packages.md
```


See [`tools/gnohome/README.md`](../../../tools/gnohome/README.md).

## Deploying

The realm **is live on mainnet** (`gnoland-1`), serving https://gno.land/u/moul.
What follows applies to a redeploy, or to a first deploy on another network.

⚠️ A redeploy of this path wipes every slot, so it is always followed by
`gnohome tx -all`. `Set` needs the package on chain first, and a `private`
package still needs `MsgAddPackage`, which no account session can sign.

**mainnet deploys in two phases.** `gnoland-1` runs
`vm:p:code_submission_policy = "inert"` (read back from the chain 2026-09-19), so
`MsgAddPackage` **parks** the bytes under `inert_pkg:<path>` and returns
`success: true` without making the package live. `Render` still answers
`package not found`, `/u/moul` is still blank, and `gnohome tx` cannot land a
single slot until an approver in `vm:p:pkg_approvers` sends `MsgEnablePackage`.

In practice that gate is an oracle, not a queue: `g1yaaa6rcp4ew5yjzdj4yms596wx2dtrj3a86704`
enabled the four most recent parked packages after 1 to 4 blocks, 3.3 to 13.2
seconds. It can still refuse, and a refusal is easy to miss, so check rather than
assume.

### The whole plan, from gnopm

Deploying is not special to this realm, so it is not this realm's tool that
does it. `gnopm publish` reads the chain, reports whether the package is live,
parked or absent, checks that every non-test dependency is already up, sizes
gas, fee and deposit from the real payload, and writes the `gnokey` commands.
It never signs.

```sh
gnopm publish -key moul moul/home     # read the report, read the script
gnopm publish -key moul moul/home > /tmp/deploy.sh && sh /tmp/deploy.sh
```

Then the content, once the realm answers:

```sh
go -C tools tool gnohome tx -all -batch /tmp/home.tx.json
sh /tmp/home.tx.sh
```

That writes one transaction holding every slot and prints the `gnokey sign`
and `gnokey broadcast` to run: one passphrase instead of one per slot, and
atomic. **Never pipe these into `sh`**: `gnokey` reads the passphrase from
stdin and a pipe takes stdin away, so the prompt fails with
`inappropriate ioctl for device`.

Run those rather than copying commands from here: anything written down goes
stale, and the tools recompute from the files as they are.

### How it sizes them

Deliberately no byte count here. This README **is part of the payload**, so any
figure quoted in it invalidates itself the moment the file is edited. The tool
reads the real numbers off the files; what follows is only the method, so a
reader can judge it.

**What travels.** `gnokey maketx addpkg` uploads with `MPUserAll`
(`gno.land/pkg/keyscli/addpkg.go`), so every `.gno`, `.toml` and `.md` in the
package directory goes on chain, **test files and this README included**.
Sub-directories are skipped, which is why `content/` never ships. The README is
usually the single largest file, and you pay gas and storage on it.

**`-gas-wanted`, at 1,800 gas per uploaded byte.** Ten successful mainnet
`add_package` transactions above h160000 cost **1,014 to 1,781 gas/byte**
(median 1,393, measured 2026-09-19). The spread is the package's own `init()`
work, which a byte count cannot see, so size from the top of the range. It is a
ceiling and a ceiling is not charged.

**`-gas-fee`, at ten times the accepted floor.** What the mempool enforces is
the `gas_fee / gas_wanted` **ratio**, not the absolute
(`EnsureSufficientMempoolFees`), so raising the ceiling raises the required fee
and headroom is not free. The lowest ratio accepted on mainnet is
**0.001 ugnot/gas**; comparable `add_package` transactions paid 0.001 to
0.00125. The tool offers 0.01. **`gas_fee` is deducted in full as offered and
never refunded**, so over-offering is a real cost and not insurance: the flat
`1000000ugnot` this tooling used to emit for a slot write was about ninety times
the floor.

**`-max-deposit`, an explicit ceiling.** Omitting it is not opting out: it falls
back to `vm:p:default_deposit`, **100 GNOT of ceiling per message**. Storage
locks 100ugnot per byte. Unlike the gas fee this one is **refundable** and only
the measured byte delta is ever locked, so headroom here costs nothing.

Re-measure before a later redeploy: gas is a function of the code, and both the
gas price and the submission policy are chain parameters.
