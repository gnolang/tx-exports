Start with a default mood.\n2. Change the mood using a function.\n3. Display the current mood using another function.\n\nHow it works together:\n\n1. When we start, our mood is set to \"neutral\".\n2. We can use the ChangeMyMood function to change our mood. \n   For example, if we say ChangeMyMood(\"happy\"), our mood changes to \"happy\".\n3. A Render function will then display the message \"My Mood is happy\".\n\nLet's dive into the code!\n\n*/\n\n/*\n\nPackage Declaration:\n\nThis line declares the name of our realm.

It then shows this combined message.\n\nThe Render function is like a display screen that shows the current state of your realm \nin a readable format. So it returns the information in a format that's easy to read, often as \nsimple text or Markdown.\n\nIn our example, it tells you what your current mood is.\n\nYour mood board!\n\nWhenever you want to check your mood, you look at this screen.\n\n*/\n\nfunc Render(path string) string {\n\n  // The function combines the words \"My Mood is \" with whatever our current mood is \n  // and returns this combined message as a string.\n\n\treturn \"My Mood is \" + myMood\n}\n"}]},"deposit":"1ugnot"}],"fee":{"gas_wanted":"10000000","gas_fee":"50000ugnot"},"signatures":[{"pub_key":{"@type":"/tm.PubKeySecp256k1","value":"ArpuZWPhPhGbXRDOr5vjwl7Ro++55QZaJ7/jUUbkpMHK"},"signature":"EP88L11GuglsytQR2cXr2HvcdP/J7mYFXIyWsFpKaANJQrv80Jo6N48oefptPQfVaFWLCrwDnHsZEKg2PdM9pA=="}],"memo":"Deployed through play.gno.land"},"blockNum":"397129"}
