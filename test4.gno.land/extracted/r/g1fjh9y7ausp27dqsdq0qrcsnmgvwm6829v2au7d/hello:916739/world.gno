	return `<pre>Open up your heart, what do you feel
Open up your heart, what do you feel… is real
The big bang may be a million years away
But I can’t think of a better time to say

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Look inside, you’ll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above

If you ever meet your inner child, don’t cry
Tell them everything is gonna be alright

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky… alright
Don’t take no for an answer, no no, alright

Right here,spread love, everybody join together now
One race, one heart, love and unity, everybody sing
yeah!

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Come on, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky
