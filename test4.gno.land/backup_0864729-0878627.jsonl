It’s designed to protect builders, workers, and communities from financial and political predators, corruption, and censorship, while also providing resilient tools for those with shared needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a personal note:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor nearly a decade, the web3 world has focused on building decentralized networks with global governance and consensus. However, I believe Gnoland has the potential to pioneer a new bottom-up approach—one that prioritizes people first, starting with local communities that gradually federate to form a global network.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy initially focusing on \u0026quot;IRL communities,\u0026quot; we could develop standards for a Proof-of-Contribution protocol that inherently includes a proof-of-humanity layer verified by local peers. For example, each year, village members could be certified as human and unique by five other village members. This would add a new security layer, enhancing local security while contributing to the long-term stability of the network by mitigating Sybil attacks, profile farming, and other threats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe notion of a territorial network is important, because I believe it guarantees resilience over time, and builds a healthy, non-speculative relationship with the global network. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach community sees its own interest defended by its local governance, in defending its village against sybil attacks, or in electing representatives at the higher level who are honest, reliable and whose experience is proven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, each community has the potential to facilitate contribution to the commons, insofar as builders respond to local needs, and are therefore very connected to local reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis work/tooling is then shared across the network, and adopted more widely, once it has proved its worth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom a historical and sociological point of view, whenever a social organization is put under pressure (war, various crisis situations, etc.), it\u0026#x27;s the most resilient organizations that become the most effective, and which then naturally draw closer together to help each other, and form a form of “federation” (e.g. the French Resistance during the Second World War).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e---\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe could start by treating ourselves—Gno core and contributors—as the first \u0026quot;village,\u0026quot; even though we are globally distributed. Organizing our efforts as if we were building the foundation of a village should be motivation enough—$tokens should not be the primary incentive for contributors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, the first 100 contributors could establish our own social feed, focused on specific topics of interest, with access initially gated by tokens. We would then simulate various village use cases, creating tools that address real-life needs while shielding ourselves from noise, speculation, and other distractions. Once this foundation is in place, we could move on to create a second \u0026quot;village\u0026quot; and begin designing protocol governance with a clearer understanding of inter-community dependencies and needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e---\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we need to consider the global network\u0026#x27;s architecture and governance from the outset, I believe we currently lack the technical and cultural building blocks necessary for ideal governance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s my intuition and the vision I advocate for experimentation on Teritori:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- We should start by addressing the needs of a small town or village. By focusing on this context, we can build resilient and genuinely useful tools for an effective, real-world community—one driven not by airdrops or rewards but by people who already cooperate due to their geographical proximity. The rise of local currencies in France demonstrates that when a currency is associated with values perceived as fair and equitable, people are motivated to participate—not for speculation, but because they see a real impact on the local economy and believe the tool benefits both the collective and individual interests.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my view, there are four essential components for a community to ensure long-term sustainability.

People are also motivated to co-own, co-moderate, collaborate, and participate in governance.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e   \u0026gt; Examples of experiments we\u0026#x27;ve conducted with Adrien (POP, Teritori co-founder) from an IRL perspective:  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e   \u0026gt; - [La Suite du Monde](http://www.lasuitedumonde.com) (The idea is to experiment with the concept of a local, self-managed commune, gradually acquiring common assets and, in future, decentralized tools for governance.)  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e   \u0026gt; - [Doléances](http://www.doleances.cc) (A POC where people gather requests to local, regional, and national governments.
